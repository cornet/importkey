Overview
========

ImportKey is a patched version of 

http://www.agentbob.info/agentbob/80/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/ImportKey.java 

with the certificate chain import code fixed.


Requirements
============
* Java 1.5+


Pre-Flight Instructions
=======================

* Make sure all keys/certs are in .der format
    
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in key.pem -inform PEM -out key.der -outform DER
    openssl x509 -in cert.pem -inform PEM -out cert.der -outform DER

* For certificate chains: cat all the certs together

    cat cert.der server-chain2.der server-chain1.der ct_root.der > certs.der

* Build ImportKey

    javac ImportKey.java


Usage
=====

   java ImportKey <private key> <certificate> [<alias>]


Example
=======

   java ImportKey key.der cert.der "My Alias"


Changing the Keystore password
==============================

To change the Keystore password to something else you use keytool which is supplied with Sun Java.

So to change it from *importkey* to *mypassword* you would do the following:
 keytool -storepasswd -v -keystore ~/keystore.ImportKey -storepass importkey -new mypassword

Also we generally want to change the keypass to the same as the storepass (it too will be set to *importkey*:
 keytool -keypasswd -v -alias "My Alias" -keystore ~/keystore.ImportKey -storepass mypassword -keypass importkey -new mypassword


Thanks
======

Kudos to Jochen Seifarth http://www.agentbob.info/ for creating ImportKey which works around keytool's stupid limitations.
